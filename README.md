# Circuit-Breaker

A circuit breaker is a design pattern used to protect against cascading failures in a distributed system. It is used to prevent a failure in one part of the system from bringing down the entire system. The circuit breaker is designed to trip when a service or component is not functioning properly and allow the system to gracefully handle the failure.

The basic idea behind a circuit breaker is to wrap a call to a remote service with a circuit breaker object. The circuit breaker monitors the remote service and when it detects that the service is not functioning properly, it trips the circuit breaker and prevents further calls to the service for a period of time. Once the time period has elapsed, the circuit breaker will allow calls to the service again and will monitor it for further issues.

Here are the basic steps to implement a circuit breaker in Golang:

Define a struct to hold the state of the circuit breaker, including the current state (open, closed, or half-open), the failure threshold, and the time period to wait before attempting to call the service again.

Define a function to wrap the call to the remote service with the circuit breaker object. This function should check the state of the circuit breaker before making the call. If the circuit breaker is open, the function should return an error immediately without making the call. If the circuit breaker is half-open, the function should make a single call to the service and wait for the response. If the response is successful, the circuit breaker should be closed again. If the response fails, the circuit breaker should be tripped.

Define functions to handle the opening and closing of the circuit breaker. These functions should be called when the service is failing and when it starts to function properly again.

Define a function to monitor the service and update the state of the circuit breaker accordingly. This function should be run periodically to check the health of the service.
